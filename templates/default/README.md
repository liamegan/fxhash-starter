## Before you mint

### Testing

Make sure you test in all browsers, on a god variety of devices, at different pixel resolutions at different window sizes. Your token should ideally appear consistent across all.

### licencing

There are many different options available for licencing an NFT. The core components are that if you do not include a licence, the rights of the token have different properties in different regions, so you're better off adding a licence to your code.

In addition to this, make sure you also include any licences to any pre-existing code you're using, this includes frameworks, snippets, etc. If you're confused about how to do this, take a look at:

Finally, ensure you include a relative URL to the licence file in a comment in your `index.html`.

### Add your token information to the index

In this boilerplate you'll find a title tag followed by a block comment in the index.html. Make sure you update this with information on your token.
